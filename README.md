# Crosswords
This project was done during my Computational Intelligence course at UT1-Capitole (MIAGE 2IS program).

The goal of the project was to apply and compare CSP and A* in the context of crosswords puzzles. 

More information can be found in the [Project Description](project-description.pdf) and the [Final Presentation](final-presentation.pdf). 

The following library was used in the CSP part of the project: https://github.com/python-constraint/python-constraint
